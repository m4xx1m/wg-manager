## Contributions
All contributions are very much appreciated, and please, to ease the merging process, target your pull requests to the [development] branch (https://github.com/perara/wg-manager/tree/dev) branch to prevent merge conflicts. Thanks!

## Features

The features of wg-manager includes:

**Server**
* IPv4 **and** IPv6 support
* Create/Delete/Modify
* Start/Stop/Restart server
* Import existing configurations
* Export server config, along with client config as zip.

**Peer**
* Create/Delete/Modify
* Bandwidth usage statistics
* Export by QRCode, Text
* Authentication via API-Keys for automation (Created in GUI)
* Automatic setup using docker

**General**
* Modify Admin User
* Create and manage API-Keys

# Dependencies
* Linux Kernel >= 5.6 *(Alternatively: wireguard-dkms)*

# Common Installation Steps
1. Enable ip forwarding:
     ```
    sysctl -w net.ipv4.ip_forward=1 # IPV4 Support
    sysctl -w net.ipv6.conf.all.forwarding=1  # IPV6 Support
     ```
2. For persistent configuration: 
    ```
    cat > /etc/sysctl.d/99-sysctl.conf << EOF
    net.ipv4.ip_forward = 1
    net.ipv6.conf.all.forwarding=1
    EOF
    ```
3. It is recommended to have a firewall protecting your servers

## Notes
* A few people has experienced issues with running the dockerized method using bridged networking. To workaround this, you can use `network_mode: host`. Note that you can no longer reverse-proxy the web interface from reverse proxies such as [jwilder/nginx-proxy](https://hub.docker.com/r/jwilder/nginx-proxy/).

## Method #1: Docker-compose
```yaml
version: "2.1"
services:
  wireguard:
    container_name: wg-manager
    image: perara/wg-manager
    restart: always
    sysctls:
      net.ipv6.conf.all.disable_ipv6: 0  # Required for IPV6
    cap_add:
      - NET_ADMIN
    #network_mode: host # Alternatively
    ports:
       - 51800-51900:51800-51900/udp
       - 8888:8888
    volumes:
      - ./wg-manager:/config
    environment:
      HOST: 0.0.0.0
      PORT: 8888
      ADMIN_USERNAME: admin
      ADMIN_PASSWORD: admin
      WEB_CONCURRENCY: 1
```
or [plain docker here](./docs/guides/docker_configuration.md)
or [build docker image from github](./docs/install_docker_github.md)

## Method #2: Bare Metal
- [Installation on Debian/Ubuntu/RPI4](./docs/install.md)

# Using the development branch
As there is no builds for the development branch, you have to do the following:
Change `image: perara/wg-manager` to
```
build:
      context: https://github.com/perara/wg-manager.git#dev
```

# Guides
- [Importing Existing configuration](./docs/guides/import_existing_server.md)
- [Reverse Proxy](./docs/guides/reverse_proxy.md)

# Usage
When docker container/server has started, go to http://localhost:8888

# API Docs
The API docs is found [here](./docs/api.md).

# API-Keys
1. Login to wg-manager
2. Go to edit profile
3. Create API-Key and take note of the key. Use the X-API-Key header to authenticate.
4. Example: `curl -i -H "X-API-Key: <key-goes-here>" http://<host>:<port>/api/v1/users/api-key/list`
5. Example 2: `curl -X POST "http://<host>:<port>/api/v1/peer/configuration/add" -H "accept: application/json" -H "Content-Type: application/json" -H "X-API-Key: <api-key-here>" -d "{\"server_interface\":\"wg0\"}"`

# Client Mode
wg-manager can also run in client-mode, with near-automatic setup and connection. To automatically setup the client,
you will need:
1. wg-manager server url
2. name of the interface the client should run on
3. wg-manager server api key

You can setup multiple clients using the numbered environment variables. The following configuration runs a server and client automatically:
```dockerfile
version: "2.1"
services:

  server:
    container_name: wg-manager
    build: .
    restart: always
    sysctls:
      net.ipv6.conf.all.disable_ipv6: 0

# Q&A
I'm trying to start the device but recieve the message: `Perhaps ip6tables or your kernel needs to be upgraded.`.
    Try: `modprobe ip6table_nat` on the host.

# Roadmap
### Primaries
- Implement multi-server support (setting up site-2-site servers from the GUI)
- Extending multi-server support to enable custom access lists (A peer can be assigned to multiple servers, as part of the ACL)
